I took my first computer courses which introduced me to the programming world. In 2003, I started developing my first web pages in HTML - CSS - PHP - FLASH. After that, because of work and academic reasons I also learned and used other programming languages like Pascal, Delphi, Visual Basic, Java, C, C++, C#, ASP.NET ... 
				Since I first learned how to program, I have seen the evolution of the technologies and the programming languages, which have helped me in the development of business software.
